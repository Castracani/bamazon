# bamazon
This project emulates an Amazon storefront utilizing mySQL and Node.js, with special considerations given towards the `cli-table2` npm package for making it look good (as good as a CLI can at least). This app utilizes three of the four CRUD operations in the SQL queries, as well as an external JavaScript file holding the table constructor.
